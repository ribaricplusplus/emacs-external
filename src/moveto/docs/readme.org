* Introduction

Moveto is used for management. It moves whatever is marked as a region to the appropriate
file.

* Notes

- It is expected that there is a config file ~/.emacs-config.json.
- Config file must contain NOTEBOOK_PATH which points to the root of the Notebook.
- The project depends on cJSON: https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON
- Logs go to /var/log/emacs-external/moveto/log.txt
- Log directory /var/log/emacs-external/moveto needs to exist and permissions need to be set to a+rw.
